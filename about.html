	I am a multidisciplinary artist playing with the lines between the organic , and human-made imagery. I paint,
sculpt, and draw but I am currently most focused on tattooing.
I am very inspired by the world around me, mainly plants, rocks, the pattern of sunlight on water and roots
curling through the earth. I am also heavily inspired by medieval and high fantasy imagery. I love the idea of
using gargoyles, goblins and demons as protectors and guardians.
<br>
<br>

I work out of a private studio in east Oakland, my practice is centered around creating a safe space where people
can play and experiment and grow into their own identity. My sessions are a collaborative experience where the
voices and opinions of my clients are always prioritized and the final tattoo will be the product of continual
adjustment and check-ins. My prices range from 200$ to 400$ depending on the size, complexity and
placement of the design. I am also currently offering free tattoos for Black folks, as well as tattoos over self harm
scars.
When I&#39;m not tattooing I love to swim in rivers, collect good sticks and rocks and play in the dirt.
